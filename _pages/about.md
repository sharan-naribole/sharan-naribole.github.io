## About Me 

I am a Wireless Communications and Networking researcher designing next-generation systems and protocols. 
I have 5+ years industry experience in modeling and evaluation of protocols and device behaviors in network-scale simulation/emulation platforms. I have actively contributed to wireless 
standards development including WiFi 802.11ac/ax/be, 5G, etc.

Currently, I am part of Wireless Architecture team at Apple Inc. designing and implementing wireless systems
and protocol models to enhance next-generation user experiences. Previously, I worked in Connectivity and Wi-Fi Systems Group, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. where I was broadly involved in protocol design and performance evaluation for Wi-Fi features and standards proposals.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rice University in 2018. I was a member of the [Rice Networks Group][rng] working with [Prof. Edward Knightly][knightly]. My Ph.D. thesis research focused on designing networking algorithms to enhance Wireless LANs with new spectrum at 60 GHz and Visible Light. 

I am actively serving as a reviewer for conferences/journals including IEEE Transactions on
Networking, IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Communication Magazine, etc. I served as a Session Chair for State-of-the-Art WiFi Technologies session of the IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall 2019.
