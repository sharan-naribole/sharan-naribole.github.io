## About Me 

Currently, I am part of Wireless Architecture team at Apple Inc. designing and implementing next-generation wireless systems and protocols to enhance user experiences.

I have 8+ years industry experience in modeling and evaluation of protocols and device behaviors in network-scale simulation/emulation platforms. I actively participate in wireless 
standards development and contribute to open-source [ns-3] network simulator.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rice University in 2018. I was a member of the [Rice Networks Group][rng] working with [Prof. Edward Knightly][knightly]. My Ph.D. thesis research focused on designing networking algorithms to enhance Wireless LANs with new spectrum at 60 GHz and Visible Light. 

I have served as a reviewer for top conferences/journals including IEEE Transactions on
Networking, IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Communication Magazine, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE ICC etc.
